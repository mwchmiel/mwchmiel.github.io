**Introduction**

During the course of my graduate degree I had the opportunity to teach extensively, and have found it to be one of the most rewarding aspects of my graduate experience. 
In order to enhance my abilities as teacher, I have completed a Certificate of Innovation in College Teaching (CICT). The goal of the CICT is to prepare educators to build a 
teaching practice that incorporates best practices in higher education, includes research-driven innovation, and addresses questions of equity and access within academia. 
While working toward including these goals into my own practice, I have benefitted by attending workshops run by the Office of Academic Innovation, learned by applying methods in the
classroom, and taking a full quarter course to better understanding the principle of scientific teaching. I have applied what I have learned to my courses, and have also reflected on 
how this impacts how i approach teaching by incorporating them into my philosophies of teaching and equity and inclusion. 

**Philosophy of Teaching and Learning**

	
The findings of a <a href = "https://www.aacu.org/sites/default/files/files/LEAP/2015employerstudentsurvey.pdf">study </a> commissioned by the Association of American Colleges and Universities regarding college learning and career success state (emphasis mine):

“The majority of employers continue to say that possessing both field-specific knowledge and a broad range of knowledge and skills is important for recent college graduates to achieve long-term career success. Very few indicate that acquiring knowledge and skills mainly for a specific field or position is the best path for longterm success…The learning outcomes they rate as most important include **written and oral communication skills, teamwork skills, ethical decision-making, critical thinking, and the ability to apply knowledge in real-world settings.”**

I maintain that these are the same skills that make informed voters, engaged community members, and lead to a personally enriching life experience. Therefore, my teaching practice centers on using subject material in a manner that explicitly emphasizes skill growth in a number of key areas. 

Primarily, I want students to come out of courses that I teach with a better understanding of how critical thinking and evidence-based decision making can improve their personal lives as well as the choices that society makes. It is important, therefore, that my students come to see science as a process of production and revision, rather than a semi-mystical field full of “eureka” moments. This normalizes the scientific process and demonstrates how scientific progress can be made by a wide variety of people. I have found this goal to be of particular importance when teaching introductory biology to non-majors, as they are often attempting to fulfill a requirement and may be apathetic toward science at the start. By highlighting how scientific discoveries are actually made, I can make the best of what is potentially their only formal academic exposure to the subject. 

A second goal that runs in tandem with the first is to promote data literacy in my students. The volume of data that the average citizen is presented with continues to increase, and being able to critically assess these data is a vital skill. Third, I look for opportunities to encourage writing practice. Science communication can be a difficult task, and proficiency is gained by repeated exposure, practice, and revision. Finally, I aim to increase natural history knowledge, and emphasize how the human endeavor, despite increasing urbanization, is still fundamentally tied to ecological systems.

To achieve these goals, I apply techniques informed by the principles of scientific teaching. I run a student-centered classroom, in which students have the opportunity to build on a previous knowledge base via engaging in active learning. I use group activities and also model expert thinking on the subject matter in order to assist students in making these connections, allowing them a variety of resources to use in order to develop subject knowledge and critical thinking skills. My experience teaching field and laboratory aspects of Plant Ecology exemplifies this model. Working together over a term, students formed interconnected learning units that work to solve problems together. This project work allowed for improvement and reiteration over time, rather than simply relying on a summative assessment at the end of the course. By using repeated assessment check-ins, I functioned in an advisory capacity toward and end product, helping to steer students toward approaches that overcame their particular group/individual difficulties. 

All of these activities are contextualized within an open syllabus, including a transparent rubric along with materials that address metacognitive learning concepts. By framing course activities within a framework that explicitly emphasizes student understanding of the broader learning goals surrounding the discipline-specific material, I aim to help students leaving my classroom further develop the tools necessary to be successful in subsequent courses, society, and their chosen profession. 



**Equity and Inclusion**<br>

Diversity, whether it be gender, class, race, culture, ethnicity, or any other dimension of categorizing human identity and experience, serves to strengthen STEM fields by providing a range of ideas and working approaches that would be absent in a homogenous population. With the benefits of diversity, come some challenges in the classroom, as students approach academic material in various ways. In order to address these challenges, I rely on methodologies that have been shown to increase classroom equity. Using diverse human and ecosystem examples when creating materials, I try to address familiarity bias as well as provide relatable content for a variety of backgrounds. The activities themselves are also varied, including active learning methods that vary student roles, ensure broad participation, and involve open ended questions. Individuals that don’t come from an academic background may have a comparatively increased academic burden in understanding how to prioritize the learning process toward performance success. In addition, these students may not take advantage of soft learning opportunities such as office hours or open labs. I am therefore careful explicitly outline a path to success relative to a class rubric, and to be clear about fuzzy learning opportunities (open labs, office hours, etc.). In this manner, I hope to undermine cultural and class biases in the classroom.

**Innovation in College Teaching in Biology**<br>

Many students experience undergraduate biology as a sink-or-swim memorization and regurgitation of facts discipline. While the discipline-specific knowledge is vast and advancement of knowledge
in the field requires an understanding of background concepts, application of scientifically-proven pedagogical techniques 

**Assessment and Evaluation of Student Learning**<br>

My approach to student assessment varies somewhat with relation to the objectives of the course, and tends to fall into one of two categories. In subject content-heavy courses (Human Anatomy and Physiology),
I take an approach that involves multiple low-stakes formative assessments. Quizzes are modeled after practical questions, and are limited in their indiviudal impact on grades. Lab tickets are exit
assessments that are worth a few points for completion, and allow students to leave the classroom with an understanding of how their personal knowledge relates to course objectives. This framework 
serves a dual role in that it allows me to gauge gaps in effective information transfer, as well as gives students the opportunity to reflect on their progress in learning the material. These allow 
me to address common misconceptions, and can also open a door to conversations about metacongitive concepts around personal learning style with individual students. These conversations frequently 
result in a student and I indentifying additional study approaches that they can add to their educational repertoire. 

Summative assessments follow the format of formative assessments, but writ large. By covering a wide variety of course concepts, my summative assessments provide students with the opportunity
to demonstrate knowledge drawn from many different course objectives. Alternately, in upper-division ecology courses (Plant Ecology, Field Methods), I typically run a project-based assessment model. 
Here, formative assessment takes the form of group and invidividual work aimed at delineating the steps necessary toward producing a successful final product. Summative assessments involve student presentations
as well as final papers that require students to engage with the higher levels of Bloom's Taxonomy in that they are producing original work reliant on data that they collect in the field. Students sumbit
final research papers, which are then evaluated and returned to them. Follwing this, I encourage revision and resubmission, a process which not only provides students with the opportunity to examine areas 
of personal improvement, but also directly reflects the manner in which scientists produce literature within their field. 

Some examples of formative assessments include [quizzes](/A&P_quiz.pdf), [lab tickets](/A&P_ticket.pdf), and [data analysis asssingments](/PlantEcologyAssignment.pdf). <br>
Summative assessments include practicals, as well as [research papers](/PlantEcologyPaper.pdf). 

**Assessment of My Teaching**<br>

I have been fortunate enough to be able to use the resources provided by the Biology Departments of both PSU and PCC, as well as PSU's Office of Academic Innovation to assess my teaching via multiple avenues.
Here I provide a number of assessment products that reflect the continued process of thinking critically about my teaching.

**Role of CICT in My Future Career**<br>

I intend to use the teaching and research skills that I have gained during my graduate career to continue teaching in a university setting. The CICT process has provided me with guidance toward
making my classroom a more student-focused space. In addition, it has provided me with a theoretical framework and actionable tools in order to address issues of equity in the classroom. As the 
culture and role of the college classroom continues to reflect changes related to advances in social equity, these tools will serve me well in adapting my teaching approach to better translate
course design into meaningful student skill acquisition and domain knowledge.
