**Introduction**<br>
During the course of my graduate degree I had the opportunity to teach extensively, and have found it to be one of the most rewarding aspects of my graduate experience. 
In order to enhance my abilities as teacher, I have completed a Certificate of Innovation in College Teaching (CICT). The goal of the CICT is to prepare educators to build a 
teaching practice that incorporates best practices in higher education, includes research-driven innovation, and addresses questions of equity and access within academia. 
While working toward including these goals into my own practice, I have benefitted by attending workshops run by the Office of Academic Innovation, learned by applying methods in the
classroom, and taking a full quarter course to better understanding the principle of scientific teaching. I have applied what I have learned to my courses, and have also reflected on 
how this impacts how i approach teaching by incorporating them into my philosophies of teaching and equity and inclusion. 

**Philosophy of Teaching and Learning**

	
The findings of a <a href = "https://www.aacu.org/sites/default/files/files/LEAP/2015employerstudentsurvey.pdf">study </a> commissioned by the Association of American Colleges and Universities regarding college learning and career success state (emphasis mine):

“The majority of employers continue to say that possessing both field-specific knowledge and a broad range of knowledge and skills is important for recent college graduates to achieve long-term career success. Very few indicate that acquiring knowledge and skills mainly for a specific field or position is the best path for longterm success…The learning outcomes they rate as most important include **written and oral communication skills, teamwork skills, ethical decision-making, critical thinking, and the ability to apply knowledge in real-world settings.”**

I maintain that these are the same skills that make informed voters, engaged community members, and lead to a personally enriching life experience. Therefore, my teaching practice centers on using subject material in a manner that explicitly emphasizes skill growth in a number of key areas. 

Primarily, I want students to come out of courses that I teach with a better understanding of how critical thinking and evidence-based decision making can improve their personal lives as well as the choices that society makes. It is important, therefore, that my students come to see science as a process of production and revision, rather than a semi-mystical field full of “eureka” moments. This normalizes the scientific process and demonstrates how scientific progress can be made by a wide variety of people. I have found this goal to be of particular importance when teaching introductory biology to non-majors, as they are often attempting to fulfill a requirement and may be apathetic toward science at the start. By highlighting how scientific discoveries are actually made, I can make the best of what is potentially their only formal academic exposure to the subject. 

A second goal that runs in tandem with the first is to promote data literacy in my students. The volume of data that the average citizen is presented with continues to increase, and being able to critically assess these data is a vital skill. Third, I look for opportunities to encourage writing practice. Science communication can be a difficult task, and proficiency is gained by repeated exposure, practice, and revision. Finally, I aim to increase natural history knowledge, and emphasize how the human endeavor, despite increasing urbanization, is still fundamentally tied to ecological systems.

To achieve these goals, I apply techniques informed by the principles of scientific teaching. I run a student-centered classroom, in which students have the opportunity to build on a previous knowledge base via engaging in active learning. I use group activities and also model expert thinking on the subject matter in order to assist students in making these connections, allowing them a variety of resources to use in order to develop subject knowledge and critical thinking skills. My experience teaching field and laboratory aspects of Plant Ecology exemplifies this model. Working together over a term, students formed interconnected learning units that work to solve problems together. This project work allowed for improvement and reiteration over time, rather than simply relying on a summative assessment at the end of the course. By using repeated assessment check-ins, I functioned in an advisory capacity toward and end product, helping to steer students toward approaches that overcame their particular group/individual difficulties. 

All of these activities are contextualized within an open syllabus, including a transparent rubric along with materials that address metacognitive learning concepts. By framing course activities within a framework that explicitly emphasizes student understanding of the broader learning goals surrounding the discipline-specific material, I aim to help students leaving my classroom further develop the tools necessary to be successful in subsequent courses, society, and their chosen profession. 



**Equity and Inclusion**<br>

Diversity, whether it be gender, class, race, culture, ethnicity, or any other dimension of categorizing human identity and experience, serves to strengthen STEM fields by providing a range of ideas and working approaches that would be absent in a homogenous population. With the benefits of diversity, come some challenges in the classroom, as students approach academic material in various ways. In order to address these challenges, I rely on methodologies that have been shown to increase classroom equity. Using diverse human and ecosystem examples when creating materials, I try to address familiarity bias as well as provide relatable content for a variety of backgrounds. The activities themselves are also varied, including active learning methods that vary student roles, ensure broad participation, and involve open ended questions. Individuals that don’t come from an academic background may have a comparatively increased academic burden in understanding how to prioritize the learning process toward performance success. In addition, these students may not take advantage of soft learning opportunities such as office hours or open labs. I am therefore careful explicitly outline a path to success relative to a class rubric, and to be clear about fuzzy learning opportunities (open labs, office hours, etc.). In this manner, I hope to undermine cultural and class biases in the classroom.
