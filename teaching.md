**Introduction:**
During the course of my graduate degree I had the opportunity to teach extensively, and have found it to be one of the most rewarding aspects of my graduate experience. In order to enhance my abilities as teacher, I have completed a Certificate of Innovation in College Teaching (CICT). The goal of the CICT is to prepare educators to build a teaching practice that incorporates best practices in higher education, includes research-driven innovation, and addresses questions of equity and access within academia.
