**The Grand Mt. Hood Bird Survey**

*Monitoring Climate Change With Community Science*

Earth is getting hotter. Species that live along mountain slopes have the option of shifting their ranges to cooler high elevations. In some places, these upslope shifts have set in motion an “escalator to extinction” where species shift upslope until they eventually run out of room. However, it is totally unknown how local BC birds are (or are not) changing the elevations where they live. In fact, we don’t have a great understanding of which elevations birds live at right now. 

Here’s where you come into the picture. Summer is a great time to get out into the cool Pacific Northwest forests to enjoy the songs and bright colors of our breeding birds. Spending an early morning going birding is a delight, and even better when you are contributing to a birder-led effort to understand how climate change might affect our local birdlife.
