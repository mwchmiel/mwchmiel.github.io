**The Grand Mt. Hood Bird Survey**

*Monitoring Climate Change With Community Science*

Earth is getting hotter. Species that live along mountain slopes have the option of shifting their ranges 
to cooler high elevations. In some places, these upslope shifts have set in motion an 
“escalator to extinction” where species shift upslope until they eventually run out of room. 
However, it is totally unknown how local BC birds are (or are not) changing the elevations where they live. 
In fact, we don’t have a great understanding of which elevations birds live at right now.
