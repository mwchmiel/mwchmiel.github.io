**The Grand Mt. Hood Bird Survey**

*Monitoring Climate Change With Community Science*

Earth is getting hotter. Species that live among mountain slopes have the option of shifting their ranges to coller elevetions. In some places, these upslope shifts have set in motion an "escalator to extinction" where species shift upslope until they eventually run out of room. However, it is totally unknown how local Oregon birds are (or are not) changing elevations where they live. In fact, we don't have a great understandng of which elevations birds live at right now.
