I'm a community ecologist focused on understanding how spatial processes influence community assembly, diversity, and function. 
I focus on theory-driven questions which i address through a variety of approaches that include strong field work and natural history components. I completed my disseration
studying avian-bryophyte dispersal networks in the <a href="http://pdx.edu/biology">Department of Biology</a> at Portland State University. I have also worked on bryophyte ecology 
in extreme environments in association with the <a href="https://www.pdx.edu/extreme-environments/">Center for Life in Extreme Environments</a>.

In addition to my research, I am enthusiastic about teaching, international collaboration, data literacy, and addressing equity imbalances in academia. 
I'm especially interested in how I can use my experience as a first generation citizen and college student to advise similar demographics.
