I'm a community ecologist focused on understanding how spatial processes influence community assembly, diversity, and function. 
I focus on theory-driven questions which i address through a variety of approaches that include strong field work and natural history components. I completed my disseration
studying avian-bryophyte dispersal networks in the <a href="http://pdx.edu/biology">Department of Biology</a> at Portland State University. I also work on bryophyte ecology 
in extreme environments in association with the <a href="https://www.pdx.edu/extreme-environments/">Center for Life in Extreme Environments</a>. I am currently
a Visiting Assistant Professor teaching both Ecology and Human Anatomy and Physiology in the <a href="https://www.plu.edu/biology/">Department of Biology</a> at 
Pacific Lutheran University. As I transition out of this position, I **am in search of the right fit for a postdoctoral opportunity.**

In addition to my research, I am enthusiastic about teaching, international collaboration, data literacy, and addressing equity imbalances in academia. 
I'm especially interested in how I can use my experience as a first generation citizen and college student to advise similar demographics.
