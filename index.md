I'm a community ecologist focused on understanding how spatial processes influence community assembly, diversity, and function. 
I focus on theory-driven questions which i address through a variety of approaches that include strong field work and natural history components. I have just finished my dissertation 
on avian-bryophyte dispersal networks in the <a href ="http://pdx.edu/biology">Department of Biology</a> at Portland State University, and **am in search of the right fit for a postdoctoral opportunity.**

In addition to my research, I am enthusiastic about teaching, international collaboration, data literacy, and addressing equity imbalances in academia. 
I'm especially interested in how I can use my experience as a first generation citizen and college student to advise similar demographics.
