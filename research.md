My primary research interests are aimed at understanding how ecological communities are formed and maintained. My dissertation work has specifically focused on 
understanding how bird behavior may influence the dispersal of mosses throughout the environment. I conduct this work at the intersection of bryology 
(the study of mosses, liverworts, hornworts), ornithology, and dispersal ecology.
